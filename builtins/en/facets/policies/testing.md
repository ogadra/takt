# Testing Policy

Every behavior change requires a corresponding test, and every bug fix requires a regression test.

## Principles

| Principle | Criteria |
|-----------|----------|
| Given-When-Then | Structure tests in 3 phases |
| One test, one concept | Do not mix multiple concerns in a single test |
| Test behavior | Test behavior, not implementation details |
| Independence | Do not depend on other tests or execution order |
| Type safety | Code must pass the build (type check) |
| Reproducibility | Do not depend on time or randomness. Same result every run |
| Do not freeze non-executable assets | Do not make prose or section structure that does not define runtime behavior a CI failure condition |
| Verify negative contracts at observable units | Do not pass prohibition, rejection, non-inheritance, or unsupported cases by exact-string absence alone |
| Mock contract fidelity | Keep external SDK/API mocks aligned with real contracts and do not freeze wrong assumptions in tests |

## Coverage Criteria

| Target | Criteria |
|--------|----------|
| New behavior | Test required. REJECT if missing |
| Bug fix | Regression test required. REJECT if missing |
| Behavior change | Test update required. REJECT if missing |
| Side-effect or state-transition change | Successful path and representative failure paths must be verified. REJECT if failure paths are untested |
| Contract changes through consolidation or abstraction | Must verify that the contract holds on existing equivalent branches, not only on the new shared path |
| Parser or configuration boundary changes | Must verify syntactically valid inputs with unexpected shapes, missing values, and isolation from personal configuration |
| Build (type check) | Build must succeed. REJECT if it fails |
| Edge cases / boundary values | Test recommended (Warning) |

## Test Priority

| Priority | Target |
|----------|--------|
| High | Business logic, state transitions |
| Medium | Edge cases, error handling |
| Low | Simple CRUD |

**Note:** When a design reference is provided, UI appearance verification is elevated to medium priority. Refer to the Design Fidelity Policy.

## Non-Executable Asset Tests

Tests that freeze prose, headings, or structure in non-executable assets such as explanations, guides, README files, or Markdown documentation are prohibited by default.
These assets change often during wording improvements and reorganization, so making prose diffs fail CI creates high maintenance cost.

| Criteria | Verdict |
|----------|---------|
| Exact prose, heading, or section-structure assertions for non-executable assets | REJECT |
| Scanning all non-executable assets only to enforce wording or terminology | REJECT |
| Tests that require explanatory files that may be deleted or consolidated | REJECT |
| Adding tests for docs-only changes when no executable contract exists | REJECT |
| Validating executable or machine-processed contracts such as CLI examples, config examples, or generated artifacts | OK |
| Contract tests for schemas, configuration, code, generators, or runtime behavior | OK |
| Not adding tests for docs-only changes that have no executable contract | OK |

Verify non-executable asset changes with review, Markdown lint, link checks, or sample command execution when needed.

## Tests for Replaced Old Specifications

When a specification change replaces elements of an old design (UI, API, events, state, labels, etc.) with a new design, tests must positively verify the new behavior. Do not freeze only the absence of the old specification.

| Criteria | Verdict |
|----------|---------|
| Adding a test that only verifies elements of the old specification are not present or not called | REJECT |
| Keeping an absence-only test from the old specification in an implementation unit that no longer owns the responsibility | REJECT |
| Changing only tests in a file whose production code has no final diff, solely to negate the old specification | REJECT |
| Positively verifying the new specification in the layer that owns the new responsibility (upper module, service, integration flow, etc.) | OK |
| Deleting obsolete tests for removed old behavior and replacing them with regression tests for the new specification | OK |

## Test Structure: Given-When-Then

```typescript
test('should return NotFound error when user does not exist', async () => {
  // Given: A non-existent user ID
  const nonExistentId = 'non-existent-id'

  // When: Attempt to fetch the user
  const result = await getUser(nonExistentId)

  // Then: NotFound error is returned
  expect(result.error).toBe('NOT_FOUND')
})
```

## Test Quality

| Aspect | Good | Bad |
|--------|------|-----|
| Independence | No dependency on other tests | Depends on execution order |
| Reproducibility | Same result every time | Depends on time or randomness |
| Clarity | Failure cause is obvious | Failure cause is unclear |
| Focus | One test, one concept | Multiple concerns mixed |

## Testing Side Effects and State Transitions

Changes involving side effects or state transitions are not sufficiently verified by successful-path coverage alone.

| Criteria | Verdict |
|----------|---------|
| Only the successful path is tested, with no verification of state after failure, interruption, or early exit | REJECT |
| Cleanup or duplicate execution for acquired, started, registered, or applied state is not verified | REJECT |
| A change affects shared state or downstream execution but does not verify rerun behavior after partial failure | Warning. REJECT when it affects a primary path |
| Mock-verified behavior is not distinguished from unverified real-integration scope | Warning. REJECT when it is a primary requirement |
| Successful path, representative failure paths, and boundary state transitions are each verified | OK |

## Testing Contract Changes and Existing Branches

When a change standardizes a contract through a shared helper, normalizer, builder, or adapter, testing only the newly added path is not sufficient. Verify that existing equivalent branches satisfy the same contract.

| Criteria | Verdict |
|----------|---------|
| Only the new shared path is tested, while existing equivalent branches are not verified for the same return value, side effect, or error contract | REJECT |
| An existing branch is treated as "preserved behavior" without verifying that it does not conflict with the contract introduced by the diff | REJECT |
| Return / throw / catch / early return paths in the changed function are not enumerated, causing representative failure paths to be missed | REJECT |
| Existing branches with the same responsibility have tests for return values, side effects, events, and error classification contracts | OK |

## Contract Test Sufficiency

When adding or changing a config value, runtime-selected capability, backend, option, permission, or output contract, tests must prove the branch conditions that change the contract, not merely that a value exists.

| Criteria | Verdict |
|----------|---------|
| Only the happy path for a new option is verified | Warning |
| Requirement-relevant branches among unset, set, invalid value, inherited, non-inherited, override, and unsupported target are not verified | REJECT |
| A user-facing display or validation entry is not verified to follow the same contract as the primary execution path | REJECT |
| A test only checks displayed values without verifying they match the resolution input used during execution | REJECT |
| Absence is verified only by exact string matching, missing order, case, whitespace, or partial-leak differences | REJECT |
| Boundary values that may be normalized at configuration boundaries, such as empty strings, whitespace-only strings, empty arrays, or case variants, are not tested | Warning. REJECT when this is a primary contract branch |
| The path from entry point to final call verifies happy, rejection, and non-inheritance cases | OK |

## Testing Negative, Non-Inheritance, and Rejection Contracts

Tests for prohibition, rejection, non-inheritance, unsupported targets, and isolation must not rely only on a specific string being absent from the whole output.
Extract observable units such as output lines, records, fields, or call arguments, then verify each forbidden value cannot leak through order, case, whitespace, delimiter, or partial-match differences.

| Criteria | Verdict |
|----------|---------|
| Exact-string absence alone is used to conclude that a forbidden or non-inherited value was not used | REJECT |
| Only allowed-value presence is checked, without proving rejected, forbidden, or non-inherited values do not reach final processing | REJECT |
| Observable units such as output lines, events, records, fields, or call arguments are extracted and checked per forbidden value | OK |
| Allowed vs rejected and inherited vs non-inherited cases are tested as pairs | OK |
| A new E2E test does not follow existing same-kind conventions for timeout, cleanup, and forced termination | Warning. REJECT when it can cause process leaks or flakes |

## Parser and Configuration Boundary Tests

At boundaries that read external files, configuration, YAML/JSON, or CLI input, testing only the ideal typed input is not sufficient.

| Criteria | Verdict |
|----------|---------|
| Array-like fields are not tested with object/null/missing values | REJECT |
| File/directory checks are not tested with an existing regular file, broken link, or permission error | REJECT |
| Tests that can inherit existing user or machine configuration do not isolate with an empty config directory or temporary HOME | REJECT |
| Syntactically valid but contract-invalid shapes are pinned to ignore, normalize, or explicit-error behavior | OK |

## Test Data and Fixtures

Test data should explicitly generate the minimum facts needed by each test. Mutating shared fixtures or using mocks that drift from real contracts reduces test reliability.

| Criteria | Verdict |
|----------|---------|
| Shared fixtures are mutated and reused across tests | REJECT |
| Mocks, fixtures, or factories return shapes that differ from real types or API contracts | REJECT |
| Each test hand-writes a huge full-field fixture | Warning. Consider a factory |
| Factories provide defaults and each test overrides only relevant fields | OK |
| Contract changes update fixtures, mocks, and snapshots in the same change | OK |

## Contract Mocks and Test Doubles

When mocking an external SDK, external API, generated client, or CLI, align mocked exception types, statuses, return values, missing values, partial successes, and idempotency with the real contract. When using test doubles for internal builders, runners, or adapters, also match production semantics for permissions, capabilities, overrides, missing values, and side effects. Type compatibility alone does not verify the semantic contract.

| Criteria | Verdict |
|----------|---------|
| Mock values are chosen by checking official specs, SDK types, generated schemas, or existing equivalent tests | OK |
| The mock throws the exception or return value expected by the implementation, and test success is used as proof of the external contract | REJECT |
| Error types or response shapes from a different operation in the same service are reused | REJECT |
| The mock is type-safe but operation-specific semantic contracts, such as existing-resource behavior, partial success, or missing detection, are not verified | REJECT |
| Internal test double drops constraints, overrides, or side effects that production always passes | REJECT |
| When real integration is stubbed, the report separates what the mock verifies from the unverified real-integration scope | OK |

### Naming

Test names describe expected behavior. Use the `should {expected behavior} when {condition}` pattern.

### Structure

- Arrange-Act-Assert pattern (equivalent to Given-When-Then)
- Avoid magic numbers and magic strings

## Refetch loop regressions

When a page performs initial loading, tests must prove that the load does not rerun because of unrelated re-renders, loading toggles, or Context callback identity changes.

| Criteria | Verdict |
|----------|---------|
| Initial load bug fix has no regression test for duplicate API calls | REJECT |
| Tests only verify that loading happened once, not that it stayed stable after rerender | Warning |
| Page tests assert call count stability across rerender or state updates | OK |

## Reachability regressions

When adding or changing user-facing features or screens, tests or equivalent verification must prove that users can still reach the feature.

| Criteria | Verdict |
|----------|---------|
| A new screen or feature is added with no verification of entry path or launch conditions | REJECT |
| Only isolated component rendering is tested, without verifying reachability from an entry point | Warning |
| The feature is verified reachable from an actual entry point such as a route, menu, button, link, or external caller | OK |

## UI library integration regressions

When introducing or changing major third-party UI components such as data grids, date pickers, virtualized lists, or charts, tests must prove that the real component mounts without crashing.

| Criteria | Verdict |
|----------|---------|
| A major third-party UI component is added or changed without a regression test that mounts the real component | REJECT |
| Prop compatibility is checked only through shallow mocks or existence checks | Warning |
| The screen is rendered from its real entry path and the primary UI mounts without exceptions | OK |
| The primary UI component is also rendered directly with representative props | OK |

## Test Strategy

- Prefer unit tests for logic, integration tests for boundaries
- Do not overuse E2E tests for what unit tests can cover
- If new logic only has E2E tests, propose adding unit tests

### When Integration Tests Are Required

Verify data flow coupling that unit tests alone cannot cover.

| Condition | Verdict |
|-----------|---------|
| Data flow crossing 3+ modules | Integration test required |
| New status/state merging into an existing workflow | Integration test for the full transition flow required |
| New option propagating through a call chain to the endpoint | End-to-end chain coupling test required |
| All module-level unit tests pass | Unit tests alone are sufficient (when none of the above apply) |

## Unit Test Criteria

| Criteria | Verdict |
|----------|---------|
| Mocking the internal implementation of the test target (testing implementation, not behavior) | REJECT |
| Sharing and mutating fixtures between tests | REJECT. Loss of test independence |
| Mock return values diverging from actual types | Warning. Use type-safe mocks |
| Only testing happy paths without boundary values | Warning |

## E2E Test Criteria

Design E2E tests from the entry points users actually use. Use code-level entry points such as routes, commands, endpoints, navigation, buttons, or external callbacks, not documentation assumptions alone.

| Criteria | Verdict |
|----------|---------|
| E2E tests are written for imagined flows without checking real entry points | REJECT |
| Hitting production APIs without mocking external calls | REJECT. Test reproducibility is lost |
| Mocking the core logic under test | REJECT. Defeats the purpose of E2E |
| Using fixed sleep for timing synchronization | REJECT. Use state-based waits |
| Sharing state between tests | Warning. Test independence is compromised |
| Only testing happy paths without error flows | Warning |
| Writing E2E tests for logic that unit tests can cover | Warning |

## Test Environment Isolation

Tie test infrastructure configuration to test scenario parameters. Hardcoded assumptions break under different scenarios.

| Principle | Criteria |
|-----------|----------|
| Parameter-driven | Generate fixtures and configuration based on test input parameters |
| No implicit assumptions | Do not depend on a specific environment (e.g., user's personal settings) |
| Consistency | Related values within test configuration must not contradict each other |

```typescript
// ❌ Hardcoded assumptions — breaks when testing with a different backend
writeConfig({ backend: 'postgres', connectionPool: 10 })

// ✅ Parameter-driven
const backend = process.env.TEST_BACKEND ?? 'postgres'
writeConfig({ backend, connectionPool: backend === 'sqlite' ? 1 : 10 })
```
