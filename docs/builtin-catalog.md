## Custom Personas

Create persona prompts as Markdown files in `~/.takt/personas/`:

```markdown
# ~/.takt/personas/my-reviewer.md

You are a code reviewer specialized in security.

## Role
- Check for security vulnerabilities
- Verify input validation
- Review authentication logic
```

Reference custom personas from workflow YAML via the `personas` section map:

```yaml
personas:
  my-reviewer: ~/.takt/personas/my-reviewer.md

steps:
  - name: review
    persona: my-reviewer
    # ...
```

## Per-persona Provider Overrides

Use `persona_providers` in `~/.takt/config.yaml` to route specific personas to different providers without duplicating workflows. This allows you to run, for example, coding on Codex while keeping reviewers on Claude.

```yaml
# ~/.takt/config.yaml
persona_providers:
  coder: codex                      # Run coder on Codex
  ai-antipattern-reviewer: claude   # Keep reviewers on Claude
```

This configuration applies globally to all workflows. Any step using the specified persona will be routed to the corresponding provider, regardless of which workflow is being executed.
